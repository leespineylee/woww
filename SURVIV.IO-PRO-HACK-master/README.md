## :angry: Hack not working?!
Be sure the links to be the same as above! (look carefully if the links are the same!)

The cheat is updating regularly so you need to change values too...

If the values are the same and everything is correct then maybe the game was updated so I need time to fix the cheat, you can create a new issue here or contact me on discord and my channel: https://discord.gg/Fc6ddGX

And don't forget to press ctrl + f5 when going to surviv.io website
